We explore the patterns in number of athletes, where they come from, female proportions for different nations and sports over the years. We explore these patterns and see how they were affected by the contemporary events, for example how world war events affected the Olympic games. Which countries wins most medals? How different are the characteristics of the athletes for each sport? What are the statistics of both summer and winter Olympic games? We will try to answer these questions through the power of data exploration and visualization.

It includes all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds to an athlete competing in a particular Olympic event. The columns are: Identity - Unique number for each athlete Sex - M or F Age - Integer Name - Athlete’s name Team - Team name NOC - National Olympic Committee (3-letter code) Height - In centimeters Weight - In kilograms Sport - Sport Event - Event Year - Integer between 1896 to 2016 Season - Summer or Winter Medal - Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA Games - Year and season Year - Integer between 1896 to 2016 Season - Summer or Winter City - Host city of the Olympics After 1992, the Winter and Summer Games were held in different years. Winter Games occurred every four years starting from 1994, and Summer Games occurred every four years beginning in 1996.

Febraur” We used group_by to group the dataset by NOC (names of the country), Year (year of participation), and Medal (the kind of medal won). This allowed us to look at the total number of medals won by each country. Using this we created an interactive plot to see the cumulative number of medals for each country across all the Olympic games We also merged the dataset with another dataset that contained the country codes for all the countries, which allowed us to look at the country corresponding to the country code In the process of data transformation, we also used aggregate functions like sum and count. We also used the .to_csv() method to convert dataframes into csv files which could be used for creating interactive plots in d3.js. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Observations", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Observations In an event, exactly three people win medals, ie. Gold, Silver and Bronze, as a result around 75% values in the medal’s column are missing. In some sporting events, the weight and height are not necessarily measured. Consequently, around 25% values are missing as well. Upon inspection, we observe that weight and height measurements are missing together in most of the cases. Since the other columns like Name, City, Sport, Sex, Team, NOC, Games, Year, and Season are very important, there are no missing values in these columns. Surprisingly, there are some missing values in the Age column as well. By simple observation, we see that these rows belong to players (for instance, S. Abdul Hamid) that participated during the Olympic Games from 1920s-1950s. We hypothesize that these records must have been lost as a result they’re missing.

Key Observations:- Modern Olympics were first organized in Athens with all-male participants from 12 countries. Winter Olympics were introduced in 1924. After 1992, the Winter and Summer Games were held in different years. Winter Games occurred every four years starting from 1994, and Summer Games occurred every four years beginning in 1996. We can also observe that no Olympics were organized between 1912 to 1920 and 1936 to 1948 because of World War I and World War II. During the Olympics at Los Angeles in 1932, the participation dipped because the Olympics were held during the great depression. During the 1976 Olympics at Montreal, there was a dip in attendance because 25 nations decided to boycott the Olympics in retaliation for apartheid policies in South Africa. During Olympics at Moscow in 1980, the number of Olympics who participated decreased because 66 nations decided to boycott the Olympics. Winter Olympics have much less participation than summer Olympics because ice and snow sports are not practical or popular in most nations due to climate conditions. This doesn’t appear to change anytime soon. 2016 Summer Olympics was held in Rio, and it had maximum participation. 5.2 Number of Events and Nations in Summer and Winter Olympics Observations- The 1924 Olympic games were held in Paris, France. Some sports were dropped like archery, field hockey and tug-of-war. Figure skating and ice hockey were moved to the Winter Olympics program and no new sports were added. The proportion of nations participating in the winter Olympics is very less compared to summer Olympics because a lot of nations don’t have the necessary climate conditions to train and participate in the winter Olympics. During Olympics at Moscow in 1980, the number nations dropped significantly because 66 nations including united nations of america decided to boycott the Olympics in protest to Russian policies. After 2000 the number of nations that are participating in summer and winter Olympics are almost constant around 200. From 1920 to 2000, there is increase in number of events every Olympics and after 2000 the number of events have saturated for summer Olympics but there is still some scope of growth for winter Olympics around 300. 5.3 Distribution of Age of participants and Medalists 5.3.1 Distribution of Age of Medal winner in Summer Olympics 5.3.2 Distribution of Age of Medal winner in Winter Olympics Key Observations:- The above plot is a boxplot of participants’ age from the Olympics in 1896 to 2016. the median age of male participants from 1896 to 2016 is between 23-26. And the median age remains almost constant. The Youngest Olympian of all time was Dimitrios Loundras of Greece, who at age 10 in 1896 won a bronze medal in gymnastics, which can be seen as an outlier in the year 1896. The oldest Olympian medalist of all time was a Swedish shooter Oscar Swahn, who was 72 years, 280 days old when he won a silver medal in the 1920 Olympics. Female Olympians were allowed after 1920, so there is no data for 1896. The median age of female Olympians first increases, then it stabilizes. Also, the spread of female participants is less than that of the male participants. 5.4 Female Participation in Olympics Plot: The plot shows the total number of female and male athletes participating in winter and summer Olympics over the years. Observations: As we can see from the above plot that the number of female athletes grew with similar pace as the number of male athletes over the years untill year 1996. After the year 1996, the male participation became stagnant with total count as ~8000, while the total count for female athletes was still increasing till the recent Olympic 2016. 5.5 Art Competitions in Olympics Observations, About 50 nations participated in the Art Competitions, and about one third won a medal. But over one third of all medals were awarded to artist from only 3 countries, Germany, France and Italy. Germany has won maximum number of medals from 1912 to 1948, but they were not invited in 3/7 Olympics as they were banned for 1920, 1924 and 1924. Despite all the ban Germany won a lot of medals in 1936 Olympics that were held at Berlin. 5.6 Most popular sports in Olympics 5.6.1 Summer Olympics 5.6.2 Winter Olympics Observations: 1) From 1948 to 1980 swimming was one of the the most popular sports in summer Olympics but after that it is not one of the 5 most popular sports. Wrestling is one of the most popular sports in summer Olympics. After 1984 all the top 5 popular sports have remained the same and the number of participants are almost same. Ice hockey was popular till 1988 and after that it’s popularity dropped also after 1998 snowboarding’s popularity increased a lot and it has become one of the top 5 popular sport. In winter Olympics speed skating has been the most popular sport for all the years. 5.7 Distribution of Height and Weight of Olympians Observations Initially we considered the plots from 1896 but since female participants were very less till 1912 and then there was first world war so we have decided to consider athletes from 1924 as were have sufficient data from that year onwards. It is clearly evident from the above plot that Male athletes are taller and heavier than female athletes in all Olympics from 1896 to 2016. In this plot we have compared the average weight and average height for athletes in 2016 Olympics in Gymnastics and Basketball. Also, Athletes who play Basketball are taller and heavier than who do Gymnastics. 17-year-old Brazilian gymnast Flavia Saraiva, is the lightest athletes at only 31kg (68 lbs) and she was also the shortest. Also, Basketball players are very tall and heavy. 5.8 Distribution of Average Height and Weight of Olymipans accross sports Observations This plot is the distribution of different sports based on the average height and average weight for the athletes from 1896 to 2016. We can see that athletes playing sports like Tug of War, Basketball, Baseball, and Bobsleigh are some of the tallest and heaviest athletes. On the other end, athletes who do Gymnastics, Synchronized Swimming, Diving, Rhythmic Gymnastics are very light and short. And most of the sports lie in between the extreme ends like football, boxing, fencing.

Along with the total number of female athletes compared to male athlete number, we have also compared the total number of medals won by females compared to male athletes. Countries that sent at least 50 athletes in Olympics were considered for this plot. Observations: As we can see that till 1920 less than 15 countries sent at least 50 athletes to Olympics. The female proportion was also less than 15%. In 1936, we can see that the number of athletes sent by countries increased and the female proportion also increased. Highest female to male athletes number ratio of ~20% for two countries Canada and Great Britain. From 1936 (just before world war 2) to 1948 (just after world war 2) the qualifying countries for this plot and the female proportions remained almost same. We can relate this stagnant phase in Olympics to slow growth of the countries when these countries were still trying to recover after the world war. In 1976, East Germany was leading in female participation with around 40% female athletes in there teams. Following East Germany were Netherlands (35%) and hen Canada (33%). Before 2016, the total participation of females was less than 50% for all the countries, but in the year 2016 there were around 15 countries with female proportion of more than 50%. The number of qualifying countries (more than 49 athletes) were also increased significantly compared to year 1976. The proportion of medals won by females compared to males was more than 50% for around 3 countries in the year 1976 while in the year 2016 total 27 countries achieved this target. This signifies the increased involvement of women in Olympics games.

But after that we see a gradual increase in female participation. It is very low in the begining and then we see a big rise in 1980s. Winter Olympics were introduced in 1924 and they were held on same years as summer olympics till 1992. After 1992, the Winter and Summer Games were held in different years. Winter Games occurred every four years starting from 1994, and Summer Games occurred every four years beginning in 1996. The number of athletes, events, and nations has grown dramatically since 1896, but growth leveled off around 2000 for the Summer Games. The Art Competitions were included from 1912 to 1948, and were dominated by Germany, France, and Italy. Nazi Germany was especially dominant in the 1936 Games. Due to World War 1 and World War 2 some of the olympics were cancelled. We also have some missing games 1916 summer, 1940-1944 summer and winter Olympics. The median age of male olympic medalist from 1896 to 2016 is between 25 and for female olympic medalist from 1896 to 2016 is 24. The Youngest Olympian of all time was Dimitrios Loundras of Greece, who at age 10 in 1896 won a bronze medal in gymnastics, which can be seen as an outlier in the year 1896 and the oldest Olympian medalist of all time was a Swedish shooter Oscar Swahn, who was 72 years, 280 days old when he won a silver medal in the 1920 Olympics. This shows the spread in the age of Olympic participants. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
